# Greenhouse Gas Emission by Food System
		
Greenhouse gas is  any gas that has the property of absorbing infrared radiation (net heat energy) emitted from Earth's surface and reradiating it back to Earth's surface, thus contributing to the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapour are the most important greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases are emitted  from various sectors like Transportation,Industry,Agriculture,Forestry and other Land Use,Electricity and Heat Production etc.This project is all about analysing greenhouse gas emission from different food stages like
land use change for agriculture,crop and livestock Production,Food Supplychain and Food waste disposal.

## Motivation

I am always passionate to explore new areas of interest. Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Food systems is one of those areas ,I want to analyze and get meaningful insights.


## Data Question

1)Which stage in food system emits high carbidiooxide in regions of low food production?

2)Which region emits high CO2 due to solid food waste? What is the major cause of solid food waste.

## Analysis

a)Almost 20% of the global green house emission are from food systems.Major contributing stage is crop and livestock production.

b)Regarding solid waste disposal, house hold sector contributes more to greenhouse gas emissions than other sectors like food service and retail.

## Known Issue and Challenges

1)Dataset has both normalised and denormalised segments in same table and no proper metadata available,which makes it harder to analyse.
2)Dataset is in the form of csv with millions of records without API facility.
3)There are about 9 countries which does not have matching FAO code or Area code.This prevents from tagging these countries to respective regions.



## Technologies

1)MS Excel
2)Python
3)Tableau

## Acknowledgements

I am really thankful for my full time cohort instructors Chris,Josh and TA Ola for helping me through out the class and also Mahesh & Michael for trusting and helping me to transition to full time cohort from part time.I would also like to thank my part time cohort instructor Amanda for her continous support.

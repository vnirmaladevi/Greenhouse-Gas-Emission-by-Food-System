Greenhouse-Gas-Emission-by-Food-System
		
		Greenhouse gas is  any gas that has the property of absorbing infrared radiation (net heat energy) emitted from Earth's surface and reradiating it back to Earth's surface, thus contributing to the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapour are the most important greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases are emitted  from various sectors like
Transportation,Industry,Agriculture,Forestry and other Land Use,Electricity and Heat Production etc.This project is all about analysing greenhouse gas emission from different food stages like
land use change for agriculture,crop and livestock Production,Food Supplychain and Food waste disposal.

Motivation

	My family has an agricultural background and I have strong interest in analysing food related datasets.We all know,climatic changes really impact crop production .Adding to that,Greenhouse gas emissions highly contribute to global temperature changes.Exploring data for Co2 emission due to food systems is really a new experience.

Here,I would like to highlight a quote regarding Food System,which will give overall idea behind this project.

“We have to change how we produce and consume food, not just for environmental reasons, but because this is an existential issue for humans”- Janet Ranganathan, vice-president for science and research at the World Resources Institute (WRI).


Data Question

1)Which stage in food system emits high Carbidiooxide in regions of low food production?

2) Which region emits high CO2 due to solid food waste? What is the major cause of Solid food waste.

Analysis:

a)Almost 20% of the Global green house emission are from Food Systems.Major contributing stage is crop and livestock production.

b)Regarding Solid waste disposal, House hold sector contributes more to greenhouse gas emissions than other sectors like Food service and Retail.



Known Issue and Challenges

1)Dataset has both normalised and denormalised segments in same table and no proper metadata available,which makes it harder to analyse.No proper API document as well.

2)There are about 9 countries which does not have matching FAO code or Area code.This prevents from tagging these countries to respective regions.



Technologies

1)MS Excel
2)Python
3)Tableau

Acknowledgements

I am really thankful for my full time cohort instructors Chris,Josh and TA Ola for helping me through out the class and also Mahesh & Michael for trusting and helping me to transition to full time cohort from part time.I would also like to thank my part time cohort instructor Amanda for her continous support.
